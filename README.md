# Youtube-SuperChat-Donations
A simple script that sums all the donations from a Youtube Livestream via SuperChat

The script relys on Xenova's [https://github.com/xenova/chat-downloader](Chat Downloader) so you need to install it:
```bash
$ pip3 install chat-downloader
```

You'll need 2 things:
- an API Key from [https://currencylayer.com/](CurrencyLayer)
- the link to a Youtube livestream
Paste these things into the script and run it.
